I recently had the privilege of developing a new web presence for the **Kafalat Yateem Foundation**, an organization dedicated to providing care, education, and support for orphaned children. The goal was to create a modern, engaging, and highly performant website that not only tells their story compellingly but also makes it easy for their team to manage content and for supporters to get involved.

This project was an exciting opportunity to leverage a cutting-edge tech stack to serve a meaningful cause, focusing on scalability, developer experience, and, most importantly, user experience for both the foundation and its visitors.

## The Challenge: Modernizing and Empowering

The Kafalat Yateem Foundation needed a platform that could:
- **Clearly communicate their mission and impact:** Showcasing their programs, the children they support, and the difference donations make.
- **Be easily updated by non-technical staff:** A user-friendly Content Management System (CMS) was crucial.
- **Offer a seamless user experience:** Fast, responsive, and accessible on all devices.
- **Build trust and encourage engagement:** Through transparent information, stories, and clear calls to action.
- **Be built on a future-proof technical foundation:** Ensuring long-term maintainability and scalability.

## The Solution: A Robust Stack for a Noble Cause

To meet these challenges, I chose a powerful combination of modern technologies, which I've refined into a starter template I call "Turbo Start Sanity." This stack provided the foundation for the Kafalat Yateem Foundation website:

### Core Technologies:
- **Frontend (Next.js App Router):**
    - **Next.js 15.2.4:** For its hybrid static & server rendering, performance optimizations, and excellent developer experience with the App Router.
    - **React 19.1.0:** Leveraging the latest React features for a dynamic and interactive UI.
    - **TypeScript 5.7.3:** Ensuring type safety and maintainability across the project.
    - **Tailwind CSS 3.4.17:** For rapid, utility-first styling and a consistent design language.
    - **Shadcn UI:** A fantastic library of beautifully designed, accessible components that accelerated UI development.
- **Content Management (Sanity CMS):**
    - **Sanity Studio v3:** A highly customizable, real-time headless CMS that empowers content creators.
    - **Visual Editing & Live Preview:** Allowing the Kafalat Yateem team to see changes in context instantly, streamlining their workflow.

    - **Page Builder** Allowing the Kafalat Yateem team to build new pages with vast library of predefined blocks
        <img src="/Projects/kafalatyateem/page-builder.webp" alt="Page Builder in Sanity Studio for Kafalat Yateem Foundation" />
    - **Next-Sanity 9.9.9:** For seamless, type-safe data fetching between Next.js and Sanity.
- **Development Infrastructure (Turborepo):**
    - **TurboRepo 2.5.3:** Managing the project as a monorepo (web frontend and Sanity Studio) for optimized build times and shared configurations.
    - **pnpm 9.12.3:** A fast and disk-space-efficient package manager.

### Monorepo Structure:
A well-organized monorepo was key to managing the different parts of the project efficiently:

```plaintext
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js frontend for Kafalat Yateem Foundation
│   └── studio/       # Sanity Studio CMS configuration
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared React components (leveraging Shadcn UI)
│   ├── eslint-config/ # Shared ESLint configurations
│   └── tsconfig/     # Shared TypeScript configurations (corrected from typescript-config)
```


## Bringing the Vision to Life: Key Features in Action

This robust technical foundation allowed us to build a feature-rich and user-centric website for the Kafalat Yateem Foundation.

### 1. Empowering Content Management with Sanity CMS
One of the primary goals was to give the Kafalat Yateem team full control over their content. Sanity CMS, with its customizable schemas and visual editing capabilities, was the perfect fit.
